    "description": "Burial's drum programming features dark, emotive 2-step garage rhythms with heavy atmospheric processing, vinyl crackle textures, and deliberately imperfect timing that evokes late-night UK rave culture. His signature sound combines syncopated shuffle patterns with ghostly, reverb-soaked percussion and environmental samples creating a haunting, nostalgic aesthetic."
